Revision history for Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable-Module-XKCD

0.06	Fri Jan  7 20:29:02 GMT 2011
	Update test suite to give the correct number of tests. git hook added
	so I can't forget to run the test suite on a commit.

0.05	Fri Jan  7 20:18:45 GMT 2011
	Correct the wrong behaviour on a failing search and add a test to check
	regressions.

0.04	Thu Jan  6 22:26:52 GMT 2011
	Fix search function again. This time, I remembered to run the test
	suite, so all should be well.

0.03	Thu Jan  6 22:06:40 GMT 2011
	Fix missing semicolon. This is why you should run test suites before
	releasing.

0.02	Thu Jan  6 21:39:33 GMT 2011
	Add in a timeout and eval block in case someone passes in a horrible
	regex.

0.01    Thu Jan  6 01:01:51 GMT 2011
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
